**My Journey in Science: Exploring Data and Complexity**

I am an evolutionary and computational biologist, fascinated by the interplay of genes, environment, and time. My research in temporal genomics, adaptation, phylogeography, and selection seeks to understand how organisms respond to environmental change‚Äîhow Darwin‚Äôs insight into ‚Äúdescent with modification‚Äù unfolds in real populations. Much of my work involves decoding genomes across time, tracing the signatures of survival and loss, and unraveling the mysteries of hybridization genetics. Increasingly, this means integrating multi-omics approaches with machine learning, combining layers of biological information with computational models to reveal patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. In practice, this often means writing scripts, building pipelines, and shaping raw data into insight‚Äîturning fragments of code into narratives about resilience, chance, and transformation.

Equally important to me is teaching and mentoring. My journey as an educator spans more than two decades, from teaching basic college biology to guiding students through the complexities of ecological and evolutionary genomics. Helping students see connections between data and life is one of the most rewarding parts of my career. I see teaching as a way of opening doors: to curiosity, to critical thinking, and to the joy of discovery.

Beyond science, I draw inspiration from literature, history, and the worlds we build. The psychological depth of Dostoevsky, the vast social panoramas of Tolstoy, the magical realism of M√°rquez and Grass, and the dramatic flair of Dumas all shape how I think about complexity, transformation, and endurance. Just as genomes are living archives of struggle and adaptation, so too are cities, landscapes, and stories‚Äîlayered with memory, resilience, and change.

Outside of research and teaching, I find joy in travel: wandering through ancient streets, hiking wild trails, or noticing the quiet poetry of everyday life. Whether I am analyzing genetic data, mentoring students, reading a novel, or exploring a place shaped by centuries, I am drawn to the same questions: how change is inscribed in structure, how diversity emerges, and how the stories‚Äîscientific and personal‚Äîthat we tell shape who we are.
