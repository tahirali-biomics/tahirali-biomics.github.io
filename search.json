Using Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae, I have investigated how heat-induced secondary dormancy, selection, and local adaptation shape population structure and evolutionary trajectories. The work combines field experiments, high-throughput sequencing, and advanced statistical modeling to uncover the molecular signatures of adaptation and resilience in natural and experimental populations. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms by which plants cope with environmental stress and the evolutionary processes underlying local adaptation.\nKey publications: - Rahnamae, N., ‚Ä¶ T.

My research in temporal genomics, adaptation, phylogeography, and selection seeks to understand how organisms respond to environmental change‚Äîhow Darwin‚Äôs insight into ‚Äúdescent with modification‚Äù unfolds in real populations. Much of my work involves decoding genomes across time, tracing the signatures of survival and loss, and unravelling the mysteries of hybridisation genetics. Increasingly, this means integrating multiomics approaches with machine learning, combining layers of biological information with computational models to reveal patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. In practice, this often means writing scripts, building pipelines, and shaping raw data into insight‚Äîturning fragments of code into narratives about resilience, chance, and transformation.\nEqually important to me is teaching and mentoring. My journey as an educator spans more than two decades, from teaching basic college biology to guiding students through the complexities of ecological and evolutionary genomics. Helping students see connections between data and life is one of the most rewarding parts of my career. I see teaching as a way of opening doors: to curiosity, to critical thinking, and to the joy of discovery.\nBeyond science, I draw inspiration from literature, history, and the worlds we build. The psychological depth of Dostoevsky, the vast social panoramas of Tolstoy, the magical realism of M√°rquez and Grass, and the dramatic flair of Dumas all shape how I think about complexity, transformation, and endurance. Just as genomes are living archives of struggle and adaptation, so too are cities, landscapes, and stories‚Äîlayered with memory, resilience, and change.\nOutside of research and teaching, I find joy in travel, in wandering through ancient streets, hiking wild trails, or noticing the quiet poetry of everyday life. Whether I am analyzing genetic data, guiding students, reading a novel, or exploring a place shaped by centuries, I am drawn to the same questions: how change is inscribed in structure, how diversity emerges, and how the stories‚Äîscientific and personal‚Äîthat we tell shape who we are.\n\n\n‚úâ ‚úâ in f X üéì\n\n\nThe mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for. ‚Äî Dostoevsky",
