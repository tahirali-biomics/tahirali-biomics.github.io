Advanced sequencing technologies—including PacBio HiFi, Oxford Nanopore, Hi-C, and Illumina short-read platforms—are used to produce detailed genomic resources for both host plants and key bacterial “hub” taxa. These assemblies provide a foundation for studying genome structure, gene content, and evolutionary dynamics in both plants and their microbial partners.

This project investigates how hybridisation and temporal selection shape genetic diversity and adaptation in Arabis and related Brassicaceae species. High-throughput sequencing, field experiments, and phenotyping are combined to analyse the genomic consequences of hybridisation in both experimental crosses and natural hybrid zones. Patterns of introgression, ancestry dynamics, and the architecture of reproductive barriers are examined to reveal how environmental factors and selection influence the persistence or loss of hybrid genotypes. Comparative analyses of hybrid populations provide insight into the evolutionary forces driving adaptation, the maintenance of species boundaries, and the role of hybridisation in diversification under changing environments.",

This project focuses on Arabidopsis lyrata populations sampled at two time points separated by ~10–20 generations, enabling direct observation of genetic responses to recent climate change. Genome-wide selection scans identify loci showing significant temporal shifts, pinpointing genomic regions under selection and providing evidence for adaptive evolution. By linking allele frequency changes to environmental trends (temperature, precipitation, snow cover), the research uncovers how natural selection acts on standing genetic variation.

By combining molecular genetics with ecological and spatial analyses, the research reveals how Quaternary climatic oscillations have shaped the genetic structure and distribution of species such as Adenophora liliifolia across Europe. The work highlights the importance of glacial refugia, postglacial recolonisation, and fragmentation of genetic diversity in shaping current biodiversity patterns. A comprehensive review of phylogeography and landscape genetics provides a conceptual and methodological framework for understanding species’ range dynamics and for designing studies that integrate genetics, geography, and ecology. In parallel, experimental studies on Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate how heat-induced secondary dormancy acts as a key adaptive trait, enabling seeds to fine-tune germination timing in response to environmental cues. The genetic basis and ecological significance of secondary dormancy are explored, showing its role in population resilience and local adaptation under changing climates. Together, these studies advance our understanding of plant evolutionary responses to environmental variability and inform conservation strategies for maintaining genetic diversity.",

The studies demonstrate that M. erraticum is far more widespread than previously thought, with populations spanning from the Alps to Central Asia. Analyses of M. perfoliatum show survival in multiple Pleistocene refugia and complex postglacial recolonisation routes, with Central Europe acting as a suture zone for genotypes from different refugia. The results highlight the interplay of climate, geography, and historical demography in shaping present-day biodiversity and provide molecular evidence for both ancient and recent migration events.",

Similarly, a comprehensive revision of Inocybe subgenus Inocybe in Central Europe has uncovered overlooked diversity and resolved complex synonymies, supported by molecular data. Beyond taxonomy, the project explores the structure and dynamics of root endophytic fungal communities in non-mycorrhizal plants such as Microthlaspi spp. Large-scale sampling and multilocus genotyping have shown that a few dominant fungal groups are widespread across Europe, with community composition shaped more by environmental gradients than by host genotype or geography. These studies highlight the hidden diversity, efficient dispersal, and ecological specialization of fungi, and provide a foundation for understanding their roles in plant health and ecosystem functioning.",

In parallel, population genetic studies of Pseudoperonospora cubensis, the causal agent of downy mildew in cucurbits, have revealed shifts in genetic structure and virulence, likely linked to hybridization or mutation events that broaden host range. Research on Plasmopara halstedii, a major pathogen of sunflower, has uncovered multiple introductions and distinct lineages across Europe, as well as evidence for host-associated genetic differentiation. These studies combine field surveillance, molecular phylogenetics, and population genomics to better understand the factors driving pathogen emergence, adaptation, and the risks posed to agriculture and biodiversity.",

My research in temporal genomics, adaptation, phylogeography, and selection seeks to understand how organisms respond to environmental change—how Darwin’s insight into “descent with modification” unfolds in real populations. Much of my work involves decoding genomes across time, tracing the signatures of survival and loss, and unravelling the mysteries of hybridisation genetics. Increasingly, this means integrating multiomics approaches with machine learning, combining layers of biological information with computational models to reveal patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. In practice, this often means writing scripts, building pipelines, and shaping raw data into insight—turning fragments of code into narratives about resilience, chance, and transformation.\nEqually important to me is teaching and mentoring. My journey as an educator spans more than two decades, from teaching basic college biology to guiding students through the complexities of ecological and evolutionary genomics. Helping students see connections between data and life is one of the most rewarding parts of my career. I see teaching as a way of opening doors: to curiosity, to critical thinking, and to the joy of discovery.\nBeyond science, I draw inspiration from literature, history, and the worlds we build. The psychological depth of Dostoevsky, the vast social panoramas of Tolstoy, the magical realism of Márquez and Grass, and the dramatic flair of Dumas all shape how I think about complexity, transformation, and endurance. Just as genomes are living archives of struggle and adaptation, so too are cities, landscapes, and stories—layered with memory, resilience, and change.\nOutside of research and teaching, I find joy in travel, in wandering through ancient streets, hiking wild trails, or noticing the quiet poetry of everyday life. Whether I am analyzing genetic data, guiding students, reading a novel, or exploring a place shaped by centuries, I am drawn to the same questions: how change is inscribed in structure, how diversity emerges, and how the stories—scientific and personal—that we tell shape who we are.\n\n\n✉ ✉ in f X 🎓\n\n\nThe mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for. — Dostoevsky",
