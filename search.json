My research in temporal genomics, adaptation, phylogeography, and selection seeks to understand how organisms respond to environmental change—how Darwin’s insight into “descent with modification” unfolds in real populations. Much of my work involves decoding genomes across time, tracing the signatures of survival and loss, and unravelling the mysteries of hybridisation genetics. Increasingly, this means integrating multiomics approaches with machine learning, combining layers of biological information with computational models to reveal patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. In practice, this often means writing scripts, building pipelines, and shaping raw data into insight—turning fragments of code into narratives about resilience, chance, and transformation.\nEqually important to me is teaching and mentoring. For nearly three decades, I have taught biology at many levels—from the foundations of genetics and ecology to the complexities of ecological and evolutionary genomics. Guiding students through this journey, helping them see connections between data and life, is one of the most rewarding parts of my career. I see teaching as a way of opening doors: to curiosity, to critical thinking, and to the joy of discovery.\nBeyond science, I draw inspiration from literature, history, and the worlds we build. The psychological depth of Dostoevsky, the vast social panoramas of Tolstoy, the magical realism of Márquez and Grass, and the dramatic flair of Dumas all shape how I think about complexity, transformation, and endurance. Just as genomes are living archives of struggle and adaptation, so too are cities, landscapes, and stories—layered with memory, resilience, and change.\nOutside of research and teaching, I find joy in travel, in wandering through ancient streets, hiking wild trails, or noticing the quiet poetry of everyday life. Whether I am analyzing genetic data, guiding students, reading a novel, or exploring a place shaped by centuries, I am drawn to the same questions: how change is inscribed in structure, how diversity emerges, and how the stories—scientific and personal—that we tell shape who we are.\n\n\n✉ in f X 🎓\n\n\n“The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” — Dostoevsky",
